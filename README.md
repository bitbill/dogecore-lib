Dogecore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Bitcoin library.

## Principles

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [dogecore documentation](http://dogecore.io/guide/). There's also a [dogecore API reference](http://dogecore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each dogecore utility.
